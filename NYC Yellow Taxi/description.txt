Yellow Taxi Data

Learning Objective: practice on implementing model from start to finish and to strengthen understanding of model drift.
Available Libraries: pandas, datetime, sklearn, and core Python 3.6+.
Data Sources: Yellow Taxi Trip Data from OpenData NYC

Read in datasets, merging and cleaning as needed.
Impute missing values (we will use median for the numeric values).
Transform features to polynomial (we will restrict to quadratic).
Split our dataset into training and testing sets.
Fit a model, or multiple models, to the training dataset.
Validate the models using the testing dataset.
This program will focus on building a linear regression model on the numerical features of our dataset to predict tip percentages.
